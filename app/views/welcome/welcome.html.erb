      <p>This Health Pod is designed to collect health information and give you an easy way to keep track of your personal health.
        After answering a few questions and measuring your height and weight, you will receive a personalised health report card
        that you can take home or discuss with your health professional at your next appointment. You are welcome to return to the Pod at any
        time to add additional information and update your report card.</p>
